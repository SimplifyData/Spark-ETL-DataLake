### About EMR - Spark ETL Data Lake IN S3

In this project, I worked on the music streaming app, Sparkify.
I ETLed Sparkify's Logs and Songs JSON files S3 Data Lake to Parquet S3 Data Lake. 

EMR Spark was used to load the data as a set of dimensional tables. 

It enabled analytics finding insights into the tracks and user logs for increase in SaaS ROI songs.

### About the EMR Spark ETL Project

As Sparkify's Data Engineer, I processed the ETL for a star schema model Data warehouse using S3 Data Lake and Parquet files.


The Star Schema Model for Data Warehouse was achived by using AWS EMR - Apache PySpark to ETL the S3 JSON Songs and Logs Data into S3 Parquet Files. 
There is a Fact table, "songplays" along with four more Dimension tables named "users", "songs", "artists" and "time". 

These Fact and Dimension tables will incoporate into designing a SQL Data Ware House.
