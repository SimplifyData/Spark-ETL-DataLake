### About EMR - Spark ETL Data Lake IN S3

In this project, I worked on the music streaming app, Sparkify.
I ETLed Sparkify's Logs and Songs JSON files S3 Data Lake to Parquet S3 Data Lake. 

EMR Spark was used to load the data as a set of dimensional tables. 

It enabled analytics finding insights into the tracks and user logs for increase in SaaS ROI songs.
